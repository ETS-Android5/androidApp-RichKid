    <string name="question1">Согласно Роберту Кийосаки одним из важнейших уроков в его жизни было как раз таки научиться понимать различия между Активом и Пассивом. Даже если сейчас для вас это звучит заумно, вообще-то все довольно просто: Активы это какие-либо ресурсы, приносящие прибыль в ваш карман, пассивы – наоборот съедающие.  </string>
    <string name="slovar1">When a person consciously or intuitively chooses a goal in life, a life task, he involuntarily gives himself an assessment. By what a person lives for, you can also judge his self-esteem-low or high.

If a person lives to bring good to people, to ease their suffering, to give people joy, then he evaluates himself at the level of this humanity. He sets himself a goal worthy of a human being.</string>
    <string name="Text1.1">Lesson 1  \n</string>
    <string name="Text1.2">Why we can not print \na lot of money  \n</string>
    <string name="Text1.3">To you this, to me that \n</string>
    <string name="Text1.4">A long time ago, money did not exist. There were people who lived by themselves: they hunted themselves and picked mushrooms and berries. Time passed, agriculture and handicrafts were formed, humanity evolved and began to gather into the first organized societies – life became easier and safer.
\nThat is how it all started.\n
</string>
    <string name="Text1.5">It turned out that each member of the community was good at one thing: some sewed clothes better than others, others made weapons, and others molded pottery. In order to improve their quality of life, there was nothing left but to exchange. So  a barter exchange appeared. People began to exchange everything for everything.\n</string>
    <string name="Text1.6"> A cow for pottery, 2 bags of rice for a knife, furs for salt - the exchange often turned out to be unequal for each of the parties. There was only one way out – to come up with one, universally recognized thing that would be long-lived and valuable in all corners of the globe. And eventually it was found.
\nEverybody called it gold. \n
</string>
    <string name="Text1.7">Bullion, robberies and banknotes \n</string>
    <string name="Text1.8">Bullions of gold was not this much convinient so, people began to make small coins. And to make the exchange even more convenient, coins were made of different "values" – for example, one coins with one value can "buy" 1 bag of rice, and other coins with other value can "buy" 5 bags of rice . The value of these coins is called their nominal value. It is obvious that, for 10 rubles you can buy more than for 7. When seller needed smaller money, the coins were simply cut into 4 equal parts. That is where their name came from - chopped money (rublenye money) or rubles. \n</string>
    <string name="Text1.9">One of the most important factors of life at that time was security. It was necessary to protect not only yourself, but also your money from unforeseen kidnappings and raids. The most trusted place turned out to be a jewelers shop. For every coin left, the jewelry house give a cash voucher, according to which it was possible to get back their savings. So, the first paper money are just notes on paper. \n</string>
    <string name="Text1.10">Over time, jewelers realized that they could charge a fee in the form of interest for their savings storage services.\n</string>
    <string name="Text1.11">That is how the first banks appeared.\n</string>

    <string name="Text2.1">Lesson 2  \n</string>
    <string name="Text2.2">This is a ”scary" word taxes \n</string>
    <string name="Text2.3">Free education, kerosene lamps and the Tax Code \n</string>
    <string name="Text2.4">It is  been 12 years since Alexs first birthday. Adult life seems to be so far and for sure rich: "Go to university” ➜ "Find a high-paying job" ➜ “Buy an apartment" ➜ “Pay taxes all the time”
\n \nWait, what??!
 \n</string>
    <string name="Text2.5">When it comes to finance, we often forget to mention the main "eater” of our money savings. It calls taxes.
Each of us lives in a particular country, which obligates itself to create laws, ensure our safety, build new schools and hospitals, take care of creating new convenient roads and power lines. And all of this can't be free. Thats why, the citizens of each country must give part of their income –  to pay taxes.
  \n</string>
    <string name="Text2.6">Once upon a time, when only coachmen on carts drove along the roads, and women wore dresses with corsets, average people lived in not the best conditions: instead of electricity were kerosene lamps which lit up at night and water was taken from wells. This kind of innovations requires pile of money. The only ones who could help were the government or rich people . So, it was necessary to take taxes from people in order to fill the Department of theTreasury \n</string>
    <string name="Text2.7">In the modern world, to find out where and what taxes you need to pay, it is enough to open the Tax Code. This code is different in each country. But the name is the same. \n</string>
    <string name="Text2.8">For example, one of the most “famous” taxes is the income tax.
This type of tax is paid from basic income, such as moms or dads salary. How does this works?
It is  simple: a citizen must give a certain percentage of his earnings to the state. For example, in the Russian Federation it is 13%, in Ukraine - 18%, and in the UK it can reach 45%. In order to avoid confusion about what and where to pay, there is a rule  according to which an employer can pay income tax for a worker. He will simply give out wages without the part of money which goes for taxes.
 \n</string>
    <string name="Text2.9">“And now, as a small quest, ask your family what income tax they pay and what percentege it is. This will help you get used to the tax in your country and calculate your real earnings (even future ones)”\n</string>
    <string name="Text2.10">Progressive tax or why the rich cry too \n</string>
    <string name="Text2.11">We did not mention the UK for nothing. The tax can be also progressive. Only from the outside this word scares! In fact, it means the higher the income, the higher the tax rate.
For example: John receives 30 thousand of some money a month, and Veronica 65 thousand. Veronika earns much more than John. It means that Veronika must pay a larger percentage of the taxes then John.
So John will pay 20% of his salary, and Veronica, for example, 30%.
 \n</string>
    <string name="Text2.12">Why do you think such a tax was created?\n \n
Lets try to answer it: if the tax was the same for everyone (by the way, such a tax is called linear), it would not be difficult for people with a large income to pay it, while people with low wages would have almost nothing left after paying off the debt to the government. With progressive taxation, the rich and the poor are at least a little, but  equalized.
\n \nIn addition to income tax, there is also a tax on real estate (your house or cottage), on land or on vehicles (yes, for each car).

\n \n"Yeah," Alex scratched behind his ear, "I'll have to rewrite my savings plan again and take into account all taxes."

    <string name="Text3.1"> Lesson 3\n</string>
    <string name="Text3.2"> Budgeting or how to save up for a laptop\n</string>
    <string name="Text3.3"> The magic of mathematics, emotional shopping and a ban on chips\n</string>
    <string name="Text3.4"> The word "budgeting” not the nicest word in the world: it's hard to pronounce and more like a banking term for people in suits.
But with the help of this term you will be able to save up for your own brand-new laptop (maybe even this year).
In simple words, budgeting comes from the word budget, that is, the plan of your income and expenses for a certain period. Hmm, already confused? Let's try another way.
\n</string>
    <string name="Text3.5"> Lets imagine that every month your parents give you pocket money in the amount of 1000 rubles. This is what we will call your income. At the same time, 800 rubles are spent on ice cream and soda per month. Plus bus rides, a couple of chewing gum and sweets – without change, the whole 1000 will come out.  And an unexpected trip to your grandmother or best friend? In general, you need to save a lot of money or you can say goodbye to your laptop. That is why they came up with such a thing as budgeting – drawing up a financial plan for a short time (let it be a month or a year) for easier control over their money.\n</string>
    <string name="Text3.6"> 1. Where to start?\n\n
And we need to start with a properly set goal. In our case, as far as we remember, the choice fell on a brand new laptop. Before solving important tasks, lets take a sheet of paper and a pen and answer a couple of questions for ourselves:
\n\n• Do you need a laptop for educational or gaming purposes? Its no secret that laptops for toys should have higher technical requirements, such as an excellent graphics card or a convenient gaming mouse, for example. And the more expensive the purchase, the longer it will take to save.
\n• Do I have enough second-hand options or do I want a brand new one?
\n• Can this subject help me earn money in the future? After all, if this is "another toy", it's better to invest money in a graphics tablet or ask parents to open their own bank deposit (read about this in the next lesson)
\n</string>
    <string name="Text3.7"> 2. When the goal is selected, you must do budgeting.\n\n
On your old computer, we will find the Excel program  and draw the field of income, expenses, unforeseen circumstances and savings as shown below in the picture. At the bottom, put down the dates (for example, months or years if you want). Knowing yourself, you will be able to put down approximate numbers in each column. Next, with the help of a little magic and simple mathematical formulas, we will deduce the amount of accumulation (how much we can accumulate in a month) as income minus expenses minus unforeseen circumstances. By the way, we recommend saving about 5% of your income for unforeseen circumstances.
\n</string>
    <string name="Text3.8"> 2.1 We calculate the accumulation period.\n\nHaving a ready-made number from the savings column for the month, it remains only to divide the amount for the laptop into our savings:
\n</string>
    <string name="Text3.9"> 8800 (laptop price) / 400 (month accumulatinon) = 22 month\n</string>
    <string name="Text3.10"> Well, not so fast. So, in order to save faster, you will either have to save more or earn more. With savings, everything is clear, but with earnings it is harder. That is why we tried and gave you a couple of little ideas for earning money for a teenager:
\n</string>
    <string name="Text3.11"> 3. Be proud of yourself\n</string>
    <string name="Text3.12"> And the last point remained – to glorify yourself for the work done!\nMaybe to someone these tips seem too simple and obvious. Well, believe me, even adults are sometimes unable to follow these rules. Can you accept challenge?\n</string>

    <string name="Text4.1"> Урок 4\n</string>
    <string name="Text4.2"> Почему банк это хорошо и почему плохо?\n</string>
    <string name="Text4.3"> Высокие проценты, ненужные прихоти и вкусные кексики\n</string>
    <string name="Text4.4"> О банке слышал, наверное, каждый человек на земном шаре. Там мы отдаём свои сбережения на хранение, берём кредит под проценты или оформляем карты. Банковская система только кажется тяжёлой и непонятной. На самом же деле в основном банки были придуманы для 2-ух вещей:\n\n
•	Одни люди, у которых были свободные деньги, отдавали их в банк под проценты. Таким образом, вложенные деньги зарабатывали владельцу еще больше денег. Такая операция называется банковским вкладом.\n
•	Но чтобы банку было откуда брать денежки и добавлять к вашим сбережениям, он должен был их зарабатывать. Это решалось с помощью кредитов под проценты, которые банк выдавал другим людям.
\n</string>
    <string name="Text4.5"> Каждый из рассмотренных случаев имеет свои плюсы или минусы.\n</string>

    <string name="Text4.61"> Банковский вклад\n</string>
    <string name="Text4.7"> В случае же банковского вклада всё происходит точно также, только наоборот.\n</string>
